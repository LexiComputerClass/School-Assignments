        <!My crocheting information>
        Crocheting is a fun hobby. If you use patterns or make patterns counting is required, but there are tools to make the process easier. Counting may sound very easy, because it is, but it is a joke among crocheters that you will learn to doubt your counting skills after only a couple of minutes of crocheting. It is pretty hard to learn, but their are some things that can help. Below I included a link to a crocheting for beginners video, and it should make the process easier to learn.
